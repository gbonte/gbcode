### Convergence of frequency
The upper figure illustrates the convergence of the frequency \(\hat{p}\) to the probability $p$.

If the frequency $\hat{p}$ is not near 1 or 0 and then sample size $N$ is sufficiently large then the $1-\alpha$ confidence interval is

$$\hat{p} \pm z_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{N}} $$
Green horizonal lines show the confidence interval for $\alpha=0.01$.



### Convergence of the difference between number of heads and tails

The lower figure shows that for $p=0.5$ the number of heads does not converge to the number of tails, or equivalently that the difference between those two numbers does not converge to zero.
