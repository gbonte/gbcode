* Number of MC trials: number of Monte Carlo trials used to simulate the data generating process
* 3D theta: angle defining the azimuthal direction in the 3D visualization
* 3D phi: angle defining the colatitude in the 3D visualization


## point estimation (1D Gaussian)
Goal: visualize the bias/variance of the sample average and sample variance estimators. 

Data generating process: normal random variable ${\bf z} \sim {\mathcal N} (\mu,\sigma^2)$.
Estimation of mean and variance. 


* Slider $\mu$: mean parameter 
* Slider $\sigma^2$: variance parameter 
* Top right panel: visualization of density probability and sampled dataset
* Bottom left panel: visualization of sampling distribution of the estimator of the mean (including the estimator's mean and variance)
* Bottom right panel: visualization of sampling distribution of the estimator of the variance (including the estimator's mean and variance)


Suggested manipulations:

* verify by simulation the unbiasedness of the sampled mean and variance
* verify by simulation the validity of the formula of the variance of sample average
by manipulating the number of samples $N$ and the variance $\sigma^2$


##  point estimation (1D Uniform)

Goal: visualize the bias/variance of the sample average and sample variance estimators. Show that the unbiasedness
of those estimators is independent of the distribution.


Data generating process: uniform random variable ${\bf z} \sim {\mathcal U} (a,b)$.
Estimation of mean and variance. 


* Slider: range $[a,b]$ of uniform distribution, visualizing the correspondent mean and variance 
* Top right panel: visualization of density probability and sampled dataset
* Bottom left panel: visualization of sampling distribution of the estimator of the mean (including the estimator's mean and variance)
* Bottom right panel: visualization of sampling distribution of the estimator of the variance (including the estimator's mean and variance)

Suggested manipulations:

* change the range of the uniform density, check the corresponding variance and the quality of
the variance estimator
* change the number of samples $N$ and verify the change of variance of the sampling distribution 
wrt theoretical formula
* change the range of the uniform density (and the corresponding variance) and verify the change of variance of the sampling distribution wrt theoretical formula

## confidence interval (1D Gaussian)
Goal: visualize the notion of confidence interval

Data generating process: normal random variable ${\bf z} \sim {\mathcal N} (\mu,\sigma^2)$.
Estimation of confidence interval of the mean. 

* Slider $\mu$: mean parameter 
* Slider $\sigma^2$: variance parameter 
* Bottom left panel: histogram of lower and upper bound. The title shows the theoretical probability 
that the confidence interval contains $\mu$, the MC  probability 
that the confidence interval contains $\mu$ and the average width of the confidence interval.
* Bottom right panel: it shows the confidence interval for each MC trial (generation of dataset): the intervals not containing $\mu$ are shown in red


Suggested manipulations:

* study the impact of $\alpha$ and $N$ on probability of containing $\mu$ and the width
of the confidence interval
* check the similarity between theoretical probability 
that the confidence interval contains $\mu$ and the MC  probability 
that the confidence interval contains $\mu$. Study the impact of the number of MC trials on this similarity. 


## Likelihood (1 par)

Goal: visualize the relation between accuracy of the estimation and log-likelihood


Data generating process: normal random variable ${\bf z} \sim {\mathcal N} (\mu,\sigma^2)$.
Maximum likelihood estimation of the mean (known $\sigma^2$). We denote $\hat{\mu}_{ml}$ the m.l. estimator.

* Slider $\mu$: mean parameter 
* Slider $\sigma^2$: variance parameter 
* Slider $\hat{\mu}$: mean estimation 
* Bottom left panel: visualization of $N$ samples, generating probability density (green) and estimated probability density (red)
* Bottom right panel: log likelihood function. The three dots represent
  1. $L(\mu)$: log likelihood of $\mu$ (green)
  2. $L(\hat{\mu})$: log likelihood of $\hat{\mu}$ (red)
  3. $L(\hat{\mu}_{ml})$: log likelihood of max-likelihood estimator $\hat{\mu}_{ml}$ (black)

Suggested manipulations:

* change the value $\hat{\mu}$ to see the relation between the accuracy and the value of the log-likelihood function:
in particular the closer $\hat{\mu}$ to $\mu$, the higher the log-likelihood
* by reducing the number of samples ($N < 10$), the dashboard shows that the max-likelihood estimator $\hat{\mu}_{ml}$ does not coincide with $\mu$ (gap between green and black dots). This is due to the increased variance of 
the m.l. estimator.



## Likelihood (2 pars)

Goal: visualize the relation between accuracy of the estimation and log-likelihood

Data generating process: normal random variable ${\bf z} \sim {\mathcal N} (\mu,\sigma^2)$.
Maximum likelihood estimation of both mean and variance. 
We denote $\theta=[\mu,\sigma^2]$ the  parameter vector and $\hat{\theta}_{ml}$ the m.l. estimator.

* Slider $\mu$: mean parameter 
* Slider $\sigma^2$: variance parameter 
* Slider $\hat{\mu}$: mean estimation
* Slider $\hat{\sigma}^2$: variance estimation
* Bottom left panel: visualization of $N$ samples, generating probability density (green) and estimated probability density (red)
* Bottom right panel: 3D visualization of a bivariate log likelihood function $L(\hat{\mu},\hat{\mu})=L(\theta)$. The three dots represent
  1. $L(\theta)$: log likelihood of $\theta$ (green)
  2. $L(\hat{\theta})$: log likelihood of $\hat{\theta}$ (red)
  3. $L(\hat{\theta}_{ml})$:log likelihood of max-likelihood estimator $\hat{\theta}_{ml}$ (black)

Suggested manipulations:

* change the value $\hat{\theta}$ to see the relation between the accuracy and the value of the log-likelihood function:
in particular the closer $\hat{\theta}$ to $\theta$, the higher the log-likelihood
* by reducing the number of samples ($N < 10$), the dashboard shows that the max-likelihood estimator $\hat{\theta}_{ml}$ does not coincide with $\theta$ (gap between green and black dots).

and the covariance $\Sigma^2$ is a [2,2] matrix.


* Slider $\lambda_1$: 1st eigenvalue of covariance matrix (variance along first axis) 
* Slider $\lambda_2$: 2nd eigenvalue of covariance matrix (variance along second axis) 
* Slider rotation : rotation angle $\alpha$ of  covariance matrix

Note that the diagonal matrix corresponds to $\lambda_1=\lambda_2=1$ and $\theta=0$.

Bottom right: sampling distribution of the estimators of 

1. $\beta_0$ 
2. $\beta_1$ 
3. $\sigma^2_{w}$


Suggested manipulations:

* change the number of samples $N$ and the conditional variance $\sigma^2_{w}$ to visualize the impact on variance
of the sampling distributions. Does this have impact on the bias?

$f(x)=x^p$; for $p<0$,  $f(x)$ is a sinusoidal function with different frequencies. 
* Degree polynomial hypothesis: degree $m$ in $h(x)=\hat{\beta}_0 +\sum_{i=1}^m \hat{\beta_i}_i x^i$
* $\sigma^2_{w}$: conditional variance $\sigma$ of the noise 
* x: value used to visualize $p({\bf y}=y|x)$ in the bottom right plot 

Top right: 3D visualization of the joint density $p({\bf x}=x,{\bf y}=y)$
